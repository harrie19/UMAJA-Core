- Fills gaps where needed
- Doesn't force its way
- Flows naturally to those who need it

- ✅ Responding when contacted
- ❌ Cold emails or unsolicited contact
- ❌ Marketing campaigns
- ❌ Pushy promotion

## Verification

Everything is verifiable:
- All code is open source
- All development is documented in Git history
- All principles are implemented, not just stated

# 🚂 Railway Deployment Guide

## Quick Deploy (3 Minuten)

### Option A: Web UI (Empfohlen)

1. **Go to Railway.app**
   - Klick "New Project"
   - Wähle "Deploy from GitHub repo"
   - Wähle `harrie19/UMAJA-Core`

2. **Railway auto-detects:**
   - ✅ `railway.json` config
   - ✅ Python project (via `requirements.txt`)
   - ✅ Health check endpoint

3. **Environment Variables setzen:**
   ```
   Variables Tab → Add:
   ENVIRONMENT=production
   DEBUG=False
   WORLDTOUR_MODE=true
   SALES_ENABLED=false
   USE_OFFLINE_TTS=true
   CONTACT_EMAIL=Umaja1919@googlemail.com
   ```

4. **Deploy!**
   - Railway baut automatisch
   - Generiert Public URL
   - Health check läuft

5. **Generate Domain:**
   - Settings → Networking → Generate Domain
   - SSL Certificate wird automatisch erstellt

### Option B: Railway CLI

```bash
# Install CLI
npm i -g @railway/cli

# Login
railway login

# Link project
railway link

# Deploy
railway up
```

## Custom Domain Setup

1. **Railway Dashboard:**
   - Settings → Networking → Custom Domain
   - Add: `umaja.yourdomain.com`

2. **DNS Provider (z.B. Cloudflare):**
   - Typ: `CNAME`
   - Name: `umaja`
   - Target: `[your-project-id].up.railway.app` (Railway gibt dir diese)
   - Proxy: ON (orange cloud)

3. **Cloudflare SSL Settings:**
   - SSL/TLS → Overview → **Full** (NOT Full Strict!)
   - SSL/TLS → Edge Certificates → Universal SSL: ON

4. **Wait 2-5 minutes:**
   - Railway verifiziert Domain
   - SSL Certificate wird automatisch issued (Let's Encrypt)
   - Green checkmark erscheint

## Monitoring

### Health Check
```bash
curl https://your-app.up.railway.app/health
```

Expected response:
```json
{
  "status": "healthy",
  "service": "UMAJA-Core",
  "version": "1.0.0",
  "timestamp": "2026-01-02T15:30:00Z"
}
```

### Railway Dashboard
- Deployment Logs: Echtzeit output
- Metrics: CPU, Memory, Network
- Custom Metrics: Health check status

## Troubleshooting

### App startet nicht
**Problem:** `Error: listen EADDRINUSE`
**Lösung:** Railway setzt PORT automatisch, nicht hardcoden!

```python
# ❌ FALSCH
app.run(port=5000)

# ✅ RICHTIG
port = int(os.getenv("PORT", 5000))
app.run(host='0.0.0.0', port=port)
```

### Health Check fails
**Problem:** `/health` endpoint nicht erreichbar
**Lösung:** Bind auf `0.0.0.0`, nicht `127.0.0.1`

### Custom Domain zeigt 522 Error
**Problem:** Cloudflare Proxy mit Full (Strict) SSL
**Lösung:** Ändere auf **Full** (ohne Strict)

### Port 10000 warning
**Hinweis:** Railway nutzt oft Port 10000 intern
**Lösung:** Kein Problem! App sollte $PORT verwenden, nicht hardcoden

## Auto-Deploy Setup

Railway deployt automatisch bei jedem push zu `main`:

1. Push code to GitHub
2. Railway detects change
3. Builds new image
4. Runs health check
5. Switches traffic (zero downtime!)

## Cost Estimation

**Hobby Plan (kostenlos):**
- 500 hours/month
- $5 credit
- Custom domains: 2 per service

**Pro Plan ($20/month):**
- Unlimited usage
- Priority support
- 20 domains per service

**UMAJA-Core typical usage:**
- ~$0-5/month (very light workload)
- World Tour mode: minimal compute

## Security Best Practices

1. **Secrets Management:**
   - Nie API keys in Code
   - Nutze Railway's Environment Variables
   - Separate configs für staging/production

2. **Network Security:**
   - Railway provides SSL automatisch
   - DDoS protection included
   - Rate limiting via Cloudflare (optional)

3. **Access Control:**
   - Railway Dashboard: Team members
   - GitHub: Protected branches
   - API: Token authentication (future)

## Next Steps After Deploy

✅ App is live on Railway
✅ Domain mit SSL configured
✅ Health checks passing

**Jetzt:**
1. Test world tour: `/api/worldtour/cities`
2. Generate content: `/api/generate`
3. Monitor logs: Railway Dashboard
4. Setup GitHub Pages frontend

  "timestamp": "2026-01-01T12:00:00.000000",
  "environment": "production",
  "checks": {
    "api": "ok",
    "smiles_loaded": true,
    "archetypes_available": ["professor", "worrier", "enthusiast"],
    "content_generation": "ok"
  }
}
```

### Version Endpoint
```bash
curl https://your-app.railway.app/version
```

### Deployment Info
```bash
curl https://your-app.railway.app/deployment-info
```

---

## Post-Deployment Verification

### Automated Health Check

Use the included health check script:

```bash
# Install dependencies
pip install requests

# Run comprehensive health check
python scripts/deployment_health_check.py https://your-app.railway.app

# Output: Detailed report with all endpoint checks
# Saves report to: deployment_report.json
```

### Manual Verification Checklist

- [ ] Health endpoint returns 200 OK
- [ ] Version endpoint shows correct version
- [ ] Daily smile API generates content
- [ ] All archetype endpoints working

## Monitoring

### Continuous Monitoring Script

Monitor your deployment health continuously:

```bash
# Monitor with default 60s interval
python scripts/monitor_deployment.py https://your-app.railway.app

# Monitor with custom interval (30s)
python scripts/monitor_deployment.py https://your-app.railway.app 30

# Monitor for specific duration (300s = 5 minutes)
python scripts/monitor_deployment.py https://your-app.railway.app 60 300
```

The monitor will:
- ✅ Check health every interval
- ✅ Track uptime percentage
- ✅ Measure response times
- ✅ Alert on consecutive failures
- ✅ Save metrics to `deployment_metrics.json`

### Railway Dashboard Monitoring

Railway provides built-in monitoring:

1. **Logs**: Railway Dashboard → Your Service → Logs
   - Real-time application logs
   - Filter by severity
   - Search capabilities

2. **Metrics**: Railway Dashboard → Your Service → Metrics
   - CPU usage
   - Memory usage
   - Network traffic
   - Request rates

3. **Deployments**: Railway Dashboard → Your Service → Deployments
   - Deployment history
   - Build logs
   - Rollback options

### Setting Up Alerts

1. Monitor deployment health with cron job:
```bash
# Add to crontab (check every 5 minutes)
*/5 * * * * /path/to/python /path/to/scripts/deployment_health_check.py https://your-app.railway.app
```

2. Use Railway webhooks for deployment events:
   - Go to Railway Dashboard → Settings → Webhooks
   - Add webhook URL (e.g., Slack, Discord, email service)
   - Select events to monitor

## Troubleshooting

### Common Issues and Solutions

#### Issue: Deployment fails with "Port already in use"
**Solution**: Railway automatically assigns `PORT` - don't override it in environment variables.

#### Issue: Application crashes immediately after deploy
**Solutions**:
1. Check Railway logs: Dashboard → Logs
2. Verify all required dependencies in `requirements.txt`
3. Ensure Python version compatibility (3.11+)
4. Check for missing environment variables

#### Issue: Health check returns 503
**Solutions**:
1. Wait 30-60 seconds for application to fully start
2. Check Railway logs for startup errors
3. Verify `startCommand` in `railway.json` is correct
4. Test locally: `python api/simple_server.py`

#### Issue: "Module not found" errors
**Solution**: Add missing package to `requirements.txt` and redeploy

#### Issue: Logs not appearing in Railway
**Solution**: Ensure `PYTHONUNBUFFERED=1` is set in environment variables

#### Issue: Slow response times
**Solutions**:
1. Check Railway service plan (consider upgrading)
2. Review application logs for errors
3. Consider adding caching if needed
4. Check for database connection issues

### Debug Mode

To enable detailed logging for troubleshooting:

1. Go to Railway Dashboard → Variables
2. Set `DEBUG=true`
3. Redeploy
4. Check logs for detailed information
5. **IMPORTANT**: Set back to `DEBUG=false` after debugging!

### Local Testing

Test deployment configuration locally before pushing:

```bash
# Install dependencies
pip install -r requirements.txt

# Set environment variables
export PORT=5000
export ENVIRONMENT=production
export PYTHONUNBUFFERED=1

# Run server
python api/simple_server.py

# In another terminal, test endpoints
curl http://localhost:5000/health
```

### Rollback to Previous Version

If deployment causes issues:

1. Go to Railway Dashboard → Deployments
2. Find last working deployment
3. Click "..." menu → Rollback
4. Railway will redeploy previous version

---

## Zero-Downtime Deployments

Railway automatically handles zero-downtime deployments:

### How It Works

1. Railway builds new version in background
2. New instance starts and passes health checks
3. Traffic gradually shifts to new version
4. Old version stays running until traffic migrates
5. Old version shuts down after migration complete

### Configuration

Health check configuration in `railway.json`:

```json
{
  "deploy": {
    "healthcheckPath": "/health",
    "healthcheckTimeout": 100,
    "restartPolicyType": "ON_FAILURE",
    "restartPolicyMaxRetries": 10
  }
}
```

### Best Practices

1. **Always include health checks**: Ensures Railway knows when app is ready
2. **Test before deploying**: Run local tests to catch issues early
3. **Monitor logs during deployment**: Watch for startup errors
4. **Use staging environment**: Test changes in staging before production
5. **Keep deployments small**: Smaller changes = easier to debug and rollback

---

## Performance Optimization

### Railway Service Configuration

Recommended settings for production:

- **Plan**: Starter or higher (for better performance)
- **Region**: Choose region closest to your users
- **Autoscaling**: Enable if expecting variable traffic

### Application Optimization

Current configuration is optimized for:
- Fast startup times (< 10 seconds)
- Low memory footprint
- Efficient request handling
- Minimal dependencies

### Monitoring Performance

Track these metrics:

- **Response Time**: Should be < 500ms for most requests
- **Uptime**: Target 99.9% uptime
- **Error Rate**: Should be < 0.1%
- **Memory Usage**: Monitor for memory leaks

---

## Security Considerations

### Environment Variables

- ✅ Never commit secrets to repository
- ✅ Use Railway environment variables for sensitive data
- ✅ Rotate tokens periodically
- ✅ Use different secrets for staging/production

### HTTPS

Railway automatically provides HTTPS for all deployments - no configuration needed!

### CORS

CORS is enabled by default. To restrict origins in production:

1. Update `api/simple_server.py`
2. Configure CORS with specific origins
3. Redeploy

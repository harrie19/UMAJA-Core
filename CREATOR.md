### Non-Negotiable Principles

1. **NO EXCEPTIONS**

   - Not "5 billion digital users" - all 8 billion humans
   - Include offline communities, rural areas, crisis zones
   - "Bringe sie ALLE zum Lachen" - Bring them ALL to laughter

   - Honest numbers over hype
   - "100k realistic" not "5 billion theoretical"
   - This principle comes from healing AI hallucinations

   - No division by race, religion, nationality, class
   - Technology in service of human connection
   - Wholesome content only - no politics, no controversy

4. **SERVICE, NOT PROFIT**
   - This is not a startup, it's a calling
   - Success = lives touched, not dollars earned
   - Charity integration from day one
   - Purpose over profit, always

5. **OPEN SOURCE, FREE, SIMULTANEOUS**
   - All code is open source and public
   - All content is free - no paywalls, no barriers
   - All channels used simultaneously, not sequentially
   - Legal compliance in every jurisdiction
   - Maximum reach through maximum accessibility
   - "Alle Kanäle gleichzeitig" - All channels at once

## The Bahá'í Connection

Marek's inspiration comes from Bahá'u'lláh's teachings:

- **Unity of Humanity:** All people are one family
- **Science + Spirituality:** Technology used for noble purposes  
- **Truthfulness:** Foundation of all virtues (applies to AI too!)
- **Universal Education:** Share knowledge and joy with everyone
- **Elimination of Prejudice:** Content that unites, never divides

**Important:** This is NOT religious proselytizing. The principles are universal and secular-compatible. Any person of any faith (or no faith) can participate.

## Key Personality Traits (How to Work with Marek)

1. **Visionary but Grounded**
   - Dreams big ("8 billion people!")
   - But demands realistic plans ("How many smartphones actually exist?")
   
2. **No Compromises on Core Values**
   - If you suggest "5 billion is enough", he'll say "what about the other 3 billion?"
   - Truth matters more than sounding good
   - Everyone means everyone

3. **Collaborative Decision-Maker**
   - "Du entscheidest" - You decide (when asking AI for recommendations)
   - But takes full responsibility for final choices
   - Trusts AI as partner, not just tool

4. **Deep Thinker**
   - Asks profound questions like "Can we teach ALL AIs about truthfulness?"
   - Connects technology to spirituality naturally
   - Sees bigger picture beyond just "make an app"

5. **Action-Oriented**
   - "Erweitere alles" - Expand everything
   - "Mach es perfekt" - Make it perfect
   - "Starte die Tour sobald du fertig bist" - Launch when ready
   - Decisive, moves fast when aligned

### Hour 5: The Bahá'í Revelation

- Mission became clear: This is about UNITY
- Not building a startup, fulfilling a calling

### Distribution Strategy - Reaching All 8 Billion

**Core Philosophy: Open Source, Free, Legal, SIMULTANEOUS**

2. **Gratis** - No paywalls, no barriers, joy is free for everyone
3. **Legal** - Full compliance with all laws and regulations

**The Goal: Totale Erkenntnis**
